---

## TL;DR

The ternary operator is a shorthand for an `if-else` statement in JavaScript. It takes three operands: a condition, a result for true, and a result for false. The syntax is `condition ? expr1 : expr2`. For example, `let result = (a > b) ? 'a is greater' : 'b is greater';` assigns `'a is greater'` to `result` if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise it assigns `'b is greater'`.

## What is the ternary operator and how is it used?

### Introduction

The ternary operator, also known as the conditional operator, is a concise way to perform conditional evaluations in JavaScript. It is the only operator in JavaScript that takes three operands.

### Syntax

The syntax for the ternary operator is:

```js
condition ? expr1 : expr2;
```

- `condition`: An expression that evaluates to `true` or `false`
- `expr1`: An expression that is executed if the condition is `true`
- `expr2`: An expression that is executed if the condition is `false`

### Example usage

Here is a basic example of the ternary operator:

```js live
let age = 18;
let canVote = age >= 18 ? 'Yes' : 'No';
console.log(canVote); // Output: Yes
```

In this example, the condition `age >= 18` is evaluated. If it is `true`, the string `'Yes'` is assigned to `canVote`. If it is `false`, the string `'No'` is assigned to `canVote`.

### Nested ternary operators

You can also nest ternary operators, although it can make the code harder to read:

```js live
let score = 85;
let grade =
  score >= 90
    ? 'A'
    : score >= 80
      ? 'B'
      : score >= 70
        ? 'C'
        : score >= 60
          ? 'D'
          : 'F';
console.log(grade); // Output: B
```

In this example, the ternary operator is used to assign a grade based on the value of `score`.

### Use cases

- **Simple conditional assignments**: When you need to assign a value based on a condition.
- **Inline conditional rendering**: Useful in JSX for conditional rendering in React.

### Best practices

- **Readability**: While the ternary operator can make code more concise, overusing it or nesting it too deeply can make the code hard to read. Use it judiciously.
- **Complex conditions**: For complex conditions, consider using `if-else` statements for better readability.
