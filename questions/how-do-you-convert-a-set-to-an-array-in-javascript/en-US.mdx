title: How do you convert a `Set` to an array in JavaScript?
---

## TL;DR

To convert a `Set` to an array in JavaScript, you can use the `Array.from()` method or the spread operator. For example:

```js live
const mySet = new Set([1, 2, 3]);
const myArray = Array.from(mySet);
// OR const myArray = [...mySet];

console.log(myArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

## How do you convert a `Set` to an array in JavaScript?

### Using `Array.from()`

The `Array.from()` method creates a new, shallow-copied array instance from an array-like or iterable object, such as a `Set`.

```js live
const mySet = new Set([1, 2, 3]);
const myArray = Array.from(mySet);
console.log(myArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

### Using the spread operator

The spread operator (`...`) can be used to expand the elements of a `Set` into an array.

```js live
const mySet = new Set([1, 2, 3]);
const myArray = [...mySet];
console.log(myArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

### Performance considerations

Both methods are efficient and commonly used. However, the spread operator is often considered more concise and readable. Performance differences are generally negligible for most use cases, but for very large sets, you might want to benchmark both methods to see which performs better in your specific scenario.
