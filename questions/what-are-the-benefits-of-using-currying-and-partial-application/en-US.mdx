title: What are the benefits of using currying and partial application?
---

## TL;DR

Currying transforms a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. This allows for more flexible and reusable code. Partial application, on the other hand, allows you to fix a few arguments of a function and generate a new function. Both techniques help in creating more modular and maintainable code.

## Benefits of using currying and partial application

### Currying

Currying is a technique where a function with multiple arguments is transformed into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. This can lead to more flexible and reusable code.

#### Benefits

- **Function reusability**: Currying allows you to create specialized functions from general ones by fixing some arguments.
- **Code readability**: It can make the code more readable and expressive by breaking down complex functions into simpler ones.
- **Functional programming**: Currying is a core concept in functional programming, which can lead to more predictable and testable code.

#### Example

```js live
function add(a) {
  return function (b) {
    return a + b;
  };
}

const addFive = add(5);
console.log(addFive(3)); // Output: 8
```

### Partial application

Partial application is a technique where you fix a few arguments of a function and generate a new function. This can be useful for creating more specific functions from general ones.

#### Benefits

- **Code reuse**: Like currying, partial application allows you to create specialized functions from general ones.
- **Improved readability**: It can make the code more readable by reducing the number of arguments needed when calling a function.
- **Simplified function calls**: By pre-filling some arguments, you can simplify the function calls in your code.

#### Example

```js live
function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

const double = multiply.bind(null, 2);
console.log(double(5)); // Output: 10
```
