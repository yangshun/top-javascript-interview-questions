title: What are the different ways to make an API call in JavaScript?
---

## TL;DR

In JavaScript, you can make API calls using several methods. The most common ones are `XMLHttpRequest`, `fetch`, and third-party libraries like `Axios`. `XMLHttpRequest` is the traditional way but is more verbose. `fetch` is modern and returns promises, making it easier to work with. `Axios` is a popular third-party library that simplifies API calls and provides additional features.

## Different ways to make an API call in JavaScript

### XMLHttpRequest

`XMLHttpRequest` is the traditional way to make API calls in JavaScript. It is more verbose and requires more code compared to modern methods.

```js live
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open('GET', 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1', true);
xhr.onreadystatechange = function () {
  if (xhr.readyState === 4 && xhr.status === 200) {
    console.log(JSON.parse(xhr.responseText));
  }
};
xhr.send();
```

### Fetch API

`fetch` is a modern and more convenient way to make API calls. It returns a promise, making it easier to handle asynchronous operations.

```js live
fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
  .then((response) => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
    }
    return response.json();
  })
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) =>
    console.error('There was a problem with the fetch operation:', error),
  );
```

### Axios

`Axios` is a popular third-party library that simplifies making API calls. It provides additional features like interceptors, automatic JSON transformation, and more.

```js
axios
  .get('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then((response) => console.log(response.data))
  .catch((error) =>
    console.error('There was a problem with the Axios request:', error),
  );
```

### jQuery AJAX

`jQuery` also provides an `ajax` method to make API calls. This method is less common in modern development but still used in some legacy projects.

```js
$.ajax({
  url: 'https://api.example.com/data',
  method: 'GET',
  success: function (data) {
    console.log(data);
  },
  error: function (error) {
    console.error('There was a problem with the jQuery AJAX request:', error);
  },
});
```
