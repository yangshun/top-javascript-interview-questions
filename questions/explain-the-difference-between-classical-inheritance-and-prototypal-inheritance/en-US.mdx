title: Explain the difference between classical inheritance and prototypal inheritance
---

## TL;DR

Classical inheritance is a model where classes inherit from other classes, typically seen in languages like Java and C++. Prototypal inheritance, used in JavaScript, involves objects inheriting directly from other objects. In classical inheritance, you define a class and create instances from it. In prototypal inheritance, you create an object and use it as a prototype for other objects.

## Difference between classical inheritance and prototypal inheritance

### Classical inheritance

Classical inheritance is a pattern used in many object-oriented programming languages like Java, C++, and Python. It involves creating a class hierarchy where classes inherit properties and methods from other classes.

- **Class definition**: You define a class with properties and methods.
- **Instantiation**: You create instances (objects) of the class.
- **Inheritance**: A class can inherit from another class, forming a parent-child relationship.

Example in Java:

```java
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.eat(); // Inherited method
        dog.bark(); // Own method
    }
}
```

### Prototypal inheritance

Prototypal inheritance is a feature of JavaScript where objects inherit directly from other objects. There are no classes; instead, objects serve as prototypes for other objects.

- **Object creation**: You create an object directly.
- **Prototype chain**: Objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects through the prototype chain.
- **Flexibility**: You can dynamically add or modify properties and methods.

Example in JavaScript:

```js live
const animal = {
  eat() {
    console.log('This animal eats food.');
  },
};

const dog = Object.create(animal);
dog.bark = function () {
  console.log('The dog barks.');
};

dog.eat(); // Inherited method (Output: The animal eats food.)
dog.bark(); // Own method (Output: The dog barks.)
```

### Key differences

- **Class-based vs. prototype-based**: Classical inheritance uses classes, while prototypal inheritance uses objects.
- **Inheritance model**: Classical inheritance forms a class hierarchy, whereas prototypal inheritance forms a prototype chain.
- **Flexibility**: Prototypal inheritance is more flexible and dynamic, allowing for changes at runtime.
