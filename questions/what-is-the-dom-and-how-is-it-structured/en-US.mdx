## TL;DR

The DOM, or Document Object Model, is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM is structured as a tree of objects, where each node represents part of the document, such as elements, attributes, and text.

## What is the DOM and how is it structured?

### Definition

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an HTML, XHTML, or XML document as a tree structure. Each node in this tree represents a part of the document.

### Structure

The DOM is structured as a hierarchical tree of nodes. Here are the main types of nodes:

1. **Document node**: The root of the document tree. It represents the entire document.
2. **Element nodes**: These represent HTML elements and form the bulk of the document tree.
3. **Attribute nodes**: These are associated with element nodes and represent the attributes of those elements.
4. **Text nodes**: These represent the text content within elements.
5. **Comment nodes**: These represent comments in the HTML.

### Example

Consider the following HTML:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

The DOM tree for this document would look like this:

```
Document
  └── html
      ├── head
      │   └── title
      │       └── "Document"
      └── body
          ├── h1
          │   └── "Hello, World!"
          └── p
              └── "This is a paragraph."
```

### Accessing and manipulating the DOM

JavaScript can be used to access and manipulate the DOM. Here are some common methods:

- `document.getElementById(id)`: Selects an element by its ID.
- `document.querySelector(selector)`: Selects the first element that matches a CSS selector.
- `element.appendChild(node)`: Adds a new child node to an element.
- `element.removeChild(node)`: Removes a child node from an element.

Example:

```js live
// Create an <h1> element and add it to the DOM
const newElement = document.createElement('h1');
document.body.appendChild(newElement);

// Get the h1 element using querySelector
const heading = document.querySelector('h1');
heading.textContent = 'Hello, DOM!';
console.log(heading); // <h1>Hello, DOM!</h1>
```
